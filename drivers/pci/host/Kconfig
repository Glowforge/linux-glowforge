	 Enables support for the PCIe controller in the DRA7xx SoC.  There
	 are two instances of PCIe controller in DRA7xx.  This controller can
	 act both as EP and RC.  This reuses the Designware core.

	  If you want extremely power save on iMX6SX PCIe, you can enable
	  the ultra low power mode during suspend/resume here. Note: iMX6SX
	  PCIe maybe powered off compeltely during suspend, and would be
	  re-initialized again during resume. Some behaviors of the PCIe EP
	  device would be impacted.
