Freescale i.MX PWM controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,<soc>-pwm"
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.
- interrupts: The interrupt for the pwm controller

Optional properties:
- fsl,extra-prescale: additional frequency divider. The effective output
  period is equal to period_ns times this value. Defaults to 1. Can be used to
  decrease the signal output frequency without affecting the range of valid
  duty cycle values.

Example:

pwm1: pwm@53fb4000 {
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
	compatible = "fsl,imx53-pwm", "fsl,imx27-pwm";
	reg = <0x53fb4000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <61>;
};
